# ML assignment 3

## iris.py
### execute command
> python3 iris.py [data_file]

### execute time
> execute time: [input number]

* e.g. run 3 times then input '3')

### print detailed result
> print detailed results?(y/n): ['y'/'n']

* If input == 'y', then it will print each test data and result.
* If input != 'y', then only print out each accuracy and average accuracy.

## forestfires.py
### execute command
> python3 forestfires.py [data_file]

Or I recommend writing results into other file rather than print on screen (since it may print a lot of lines):
> python3 forestfires.py [data_file] > result.txt

### execute time
> execute time: [input number]

### print detailed result
> print detailed results?(y/n): ['y'/'n']

* If input == 'y', then it will print each test data and result.
* If input != 'y', then only print out each difference and average differences.
